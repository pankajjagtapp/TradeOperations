# P2P Trade Operations

Functionalities:-

1. User can create a Buy and a Sell Order for Buying or Selling ERC20 Tokens
2. Bidder can make bids for the orderId
3. Logging of all data with structures
4. Trade Execution
    - User chooses the bidder to trade with from the Bidders Array
    - User provides the index of the bidder from the array
    - User had placed a Buy order, user sent eth to contract; Bidder sent tokens to contract
    - So, now send tokens to user and Eth to bidder
    - Similarly for Sell Orders
